## Computer Graphics - Assignment 2

Simple Pong clone where the player plays against the computer up to 10 points.

Use W/S or Up/Down arrows to move the player's paddle

The project uses pipenv, so to run it you need to have pipenv installed and then run `pipenv install` in the project directory to make sure all required packages are installed. Then run `pipenv run python main.py` to start the game (may run fine without pipenv, it simply makes sure the correct versions of the packages are installed)
